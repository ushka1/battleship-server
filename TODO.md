# TODO

## High Priority

1. Communication improvement, send errors/warnings, handle possible errors.
1. Logging.
1. Socket locking (middleware + using channels).

## Medium Priority

1. Same player join your own room.
1. I'm not handling case when someone alters database, that's not my job.
1. Server down -> try to recreate everything, users will be unique so this may be possible.
1. Remove inactive users after some time (e.g. 30 days).

## Low Priority

1. Account created automatically and bind something to ip or something?
1. Reset option.
1. Chat.
